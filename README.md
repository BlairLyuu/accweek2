Building this site over the last two weeks was a "return to basics" for me. Last semester, my first website was mostly "vibe coding"，as it looked okay, but I didn’t completely understand the logic behind it. This time, I deliberately chose a minimalist style, stripping away the flashy animations to focus entirely on mastering CSS Grid and the core layout principles we've been learning.

The process was definitely more challenging than it looks. I ran into several hurdles, like fixing broken image paths and figuring out how to display 16:10 game screenshots alongside 3:4 posters without anything looking distorted. Using the `aspect-ratio` property was a game-changer for keeping the gallery organized. I also spent a lot of time tweaking the About page, moving from a `1fr 2fr` grid to a `2fr 3fr` split to finally get the visual balance right.
